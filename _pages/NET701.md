#### Advice - initial setup
<small>August 12 2020</small>

A few pieces of advice to set up you Vmware workshop environment.

* Work structured with you allocation of switches and IP addresses. Write it down and have a naming convention for you network components
* Always install Vmware tools on your you machines whenever you can
* Test connections before you progress
* Work out you own personal diagram of your environment – so you have the best possible overview

Forget the Windows10 client that you where asked to set up last time for a bit – we might need it later. But set it up in your network with it’s own IP an Internet access

Install the following machines: 

ESXi01
6 vCPU
12GB RAM
200GB Hard Disk

ESXi01
6 vCPU
12GB RAM
100GB Hard Disk

Windows2016 Server
4 vCPU
6GB RAM
Two 100GB Hard Disk

#### Plan for the coming week
<small>August 10 2020</small>

We will get the environment installed with the help from Sinhara. He will also bring a diagram on Wednesday that you can follow.

To support you, I have created links in this blog to a couple of the student blogs from last year.
I have also created a collection of presentations and other resources in the ‘files’ section of our NET701 MS Teams space. You can have a look in there, but I will probably also discuss some of them in the classroom.

See you on Wednesday.

#### First blog posting
<small>August 3 2020</small>

The first blog psting is your personal recount of the presntation on Wednesday the 5th of August

#### Current Trends for Interprise Infrastructure - Presentations
<small>July 30 2020</small>

This will be the student presentations, Wednesday the 5th of August:

* **Open Stack** by Blake, Jayden and Regan
* **Intrinsic Security** by Aileen, Nikhil, Anushka & Lanka
* **Container Technology/Docker** by Mahir & Luke
* **IoT – Business Applications Ready for Adaption** by David, Mariya and Suhaib
* **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** by Akhil, Vishnu, Vishnupriya & Asha

#### No ICM resources - create presentations instead
<small>July 30 2020</small>

Unfortunately, there is a lot of problems getting access to the the VMware Install, Configure & Manage (ICM) lab resources. I had an email today that it was solved – only to find out that it did not work.

So I have to resolve to a backup plan: You will do research today in groups about current Enterprise Infrastructure, trends, solutions and approaches. You will present it next week, hopefully we have the solved the problems by then. Or I will have found an alternative approach.

I have found a few resources, listed here below:

* [Enterprise IT Infrastructure](https://witanworld.com/article/2019/09/25/enterprise-infrastructure/#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20Enterprise%20IT%20Infrastructure,of%20an%20enterprise%20IT%20environment.)
* [Why Use OpenStack In The Enterprise](https://www.openstack.org/enterprise/)
* [8 Enterprise Technology Predictions for 2020](https://www.vmware.com/radius/enterprise-tech-trends-2020/)
* [Infrastructure as Code: What Is It? Why Is It Important?](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/)

The idea is that you pick one of the trends in the articles and present it. But we will have to communicate your choice beforehand so there are no overlaps and irrelevant topics.

#### What is the NET701 blog? 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the NET701 Class Blog Space. News, instructions, ideas....they will all be posted here instead of Moodle. Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
