#### No ICM resources - create presentations instead
<small>July 30 2020</small>

Unfortunately, there is a lot of problems getting access to the the VMware Install, Configure & Manage (ICM) lab resources. I had an email today that it was solved – only to find out that it did not work.

So I have to resolve to a backup plan: You will do research today in groups about current Enterprise Infrastructure, trends, solutions and approaches. You will present it next week, hopefully we have the solved the problems by then. Or I will have found an alternative approach.

I have found a few resources, listed here below:

* [Enterprise IT Infrastructure](https://witanworld.com/article/2019/09/25/enterprise-infrastructure/#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20Enterprise%20IT%20Infrastructure,of%20an%20enterprise%20IT%20environment.)
* [Why Use OpenStack In The Enterprise](https://www.openstack.org/enterprise/)
* [8 Enterprise Technology Predictions for 2020](https://www.vmware.com/radius/enterprise-tech-trends-2020/)
* [Infrastructure as Code: What Is It? Why Is It Important?](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/)

The idea is that you pick one of the trends in the articles and present it. But we will have to communicate your choice beforehand so there are no overlaps and irrelevant topics.

#### What is the NET701 blog? 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the NET701 Class Blog Space. News, instructions, ideas....they will all be posted here instead of Moodle. Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
