#### 3-2-1 Backup Stratregy 
<small>August 13 2020</small>

A 3-2-1 strategy means having at least three total copies of your data, two of which are local but on different mediums (read: devices), and at least one copy offsite.

#### Installing in Ubuntu – a jungle
<small>August 14 2020</small>

It can be a challenge to find a good way of installing software in Ubuntu. I general Ubuntu is a part of the big general GNU Linux distribution called Debian. Therefore everything that applies to Debian also applies to Ubuntu. For example, when you find and download installation packages, choose the ones ending with .deb  

The ‘orange box’ Software Centre in Ubuntu is a tempting place to go. But it is using something called ‘snap’ and therefore often not directly connected to current development branches. Also, snap is rather new in the Linux world an not totally reliable. Also when it comes to application dependencies. Snap can also be run from the CLI (command line)

Another option (better) is to start with the CLI from the beginning. It usually involves 3 steps (lines) that are always defined in the installation instruction.

You can also download the .deb package and extract it. It can be done with the Software Centre Application (Orange box). Just choose it instead of unpacking the package. And make sure the downloaded package is sitting an appropriate place before you install – for example you home folder. You delete the .tar file after installation.

You can also use another pckage managers, such as Gdebi:

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gdebi

Or you can use the CLI fully, by first unpacking the application folder, then navigating into it and run sudo apt install ./my_filename.deb or the dpkg command.

Isn’t the world of Linux just wonderful?

#### Problems with GRUP after a few dual boot session
<small>August 12 2020</small>

After having wasted so much time on dual-boot installations that did not work after having booted up a couple of times, we might just have found one solution - make sure to create an initial Partition Table in **gpt** format before you do anything else with your harddrive/SSD.

Also, and more importantly, it appears that the bootloader of windows10 wants to take over. It can possibly be solved by running this in a Windows command prompt wth admin rights: bcdedit/set{bootmgr}path\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi

#### Bootable USB toolbox
<small>August 12 2020</small>

To create a bootable USB, you can use [Unetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)

The following bootable USB drives can come in handy - during this course and possibly after:

* [Windows](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=9f428e23-ed89-4828-8c87-a6a981fed7f4#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/software)
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [GParted](https://gparted.org/download.php)
* [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/downloads.php)
