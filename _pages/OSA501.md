#### The OSA501 blog

This is the OSA501 Class Blog Space. News, instructions, ideas....they will all be posted here instead of Moodle. Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.

#### Windows10 unattended installation and answer file  
<small>August 17 2020</small>

When you start a new installation of Windows 10, you must go through the Windows Setup, which is the experience that helps you to configure various settings, including language preferences, product key, and partition layout. After the installation, you also have to go through the out-of-box experience (OOBE), which you need to complete to configure settings like keyboard layout, account, and privacy settings.

Although the process is relatively easy for most people, you still wouldn’t like to go through all of these steps if you need to complete multiple installations in your workplace.

The installation process can be automated (and save time in the process), if you create an ‘answer file’ with instructions to complete every on-screen prompt.

In enterprise environments, there is a variety of tools available to do this – but they are all operating with the same concept of an ‘answer file’.

Therefore I would like you to give it a go – creating and possibly using an answer file. 

**Word of warning**
I am saying “give it a go” and “possibly”, because this is really only something enterprises do and Microsoft is changing the Windows installation images and procedures so often, that it is very likely that your answer file won’t work. But – document in your blog what you are doing

**Trying you new installation image with an answer file included**
When you have followed the guide in the link above, you can test it. Ask for a new HD – or do a virtual installation. Don’t ruin your hard earned dual boot system – unless you want to  :)   

#### 3-2-1 Backup Stratregy 
<small>August 13 2020</small>

A 3-2-1 strategy means having at least three total copies of your data, two of which are local but on different mediums (read: devices), and at least one copy offsite.

#### Installing in Ubuntu – a jungle
<small>August 14 2020</small>

It can be a challenge to find a good way of installing software in Ubuntu. I general Ubuntu is a part of the big general GNU Linux distribution called Debian. Therefore everything that applies to Debian also applies to Ubuntu. For example, when you find and download installation packages, choose the ones ending with .deb  

The ‘orange box’ Software Centre in Ubuntu is a tempting place to go. But it is using something called ‘snap’ and therefore often not directly connected to current development branches. Also, snap is rather new in the Linux world and not totally reliable. Also when it comes to application dependencies. Snap can also be run from the CLI (command line)

Another option (better) is to start with the CLI from the beginning. It usually involves 3 steps (lines) that are always defined in the installation instruction.

You can also download the .deb package and extract it. It can be done with the Software Centre Application (Orange box). Just choose it instead of unpacking the package. And make sure the downloaded package is sitting an appropriate place before you install – for example you home folder. You delete the .tar file after installation.

You can also use another pckage managers, such as Gdebi:

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gdebi

Or you can use the CLI fully, by first unpacking the application folder, then navigating into it and run sudo apt install ./my_filename.deb or the dpkg command.

Isn’t the world of Linux just wonderful?

#### Ubuntu – and it’s flavours

#### Problems with GRUP after a few dual boot session
<small>August 12 2020</small>

After having wasted so much time on dual-boot installations that did not work after having booted up a couple of times, we might just have found one solution - make sure to create an initial Partition Table in **gpt** format before you do anything else with your harddrive/SSD.

Also, and more importantly, it appears that the bootloader of windows10 wants to take over. It can possibly be solved by running this in a Windows command prompt wth admin rights: bcdedit/set{bootmgr}path\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi

#### Bootable USB toolbox
<small>August 12 2020</small>

To create a bootable USB, you can use [Unetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)

The following bootable USB drives can come in handy - during this course and possibly after:

* [Windows](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=9f428e23-ed89-4828-8c87-a6a981fed7f4#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/software)
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [GParted](https://gparted.org/download.php)
