#### Problems with GRUP after a few dual boot session
<small>August 12 2020</small>

After having wasted so much time on dual-boot installations that did not work after having booted up a couple of times, we might just have found one solution - make sure to create an initial Partition Table in **gpt** format before you do anything else with your harddrive/SSD.

Also, and more importantly, it appears that the bootloader of windows10 wants to take over. It can possibly be solved by running this in a Windows command prompt wth admin rights: bcdedit/set{bootmgr}path\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi

#### Bootable USB toolbox

To create a bootable USB, you can use [Unetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)

The following bootable USB drives can come in handy - during this course and possibly after:

* [Windows](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=9f428e23-ed89-4828-8c87-a6a981fed7f4#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/software)
