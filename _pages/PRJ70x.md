#### The old PRJ70x blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new RES701 Class Blog Space, built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
We are also in the process of building a new public site/platform built to connect employers and students for work placements, job opportunities, etc. There will also be information for employers - and other interested parties - regarding placement procedures, previous projects...
During this transition there might still be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old PRJ70x blog](https://prj701.wordpress.com/)
