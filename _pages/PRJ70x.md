#### Welcome to Semester 1, 2020 
<small>February 25 2020</small>

Welcome to semester 1, 2020. I am Lars, and I will be the coordinator for the Project Paper.

We are having our first session for student new to the paper on Friday, 28th of March. Everyone who currently enrolled in PRJ701/702 (not if you are starting in Semester 2, though) and/or already working on a project should attend, so we are sure that all project students meet and share information, questions and experiences.

The way the information for this course is organised, is that corse descriptions, assessment schedules, assessment guidelines, drop boxes, etc. – in short all static official information – is sitting on the Moodle Site. This WordPress blog is our dynamic communication interface – including tips, links, guides and information about previous projects.

Please take time to have a good read through the course documents.  The course can appear complicated at first sight – so it is important that you get an overview of the structure before we meet.

Warm regards, Lars

#### The old PRJ70x blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new RES701 Class Blog Space, built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
We are also in the process of building a new public site/platform to connect employers and students for work placements, job opportunities, etc. There will also be information for employers - and other interested parties - regarding placement procedures, previous projects...
During this transition there might still be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old PRJ70x blog](https://prj701.wordpress.com/)
