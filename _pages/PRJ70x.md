#### Information for Employers

[Information about work placements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14qwiR31bcNPN71qNiiP12vGPh1oDoaAcJSpzzCGkW34/edit?usp=sharing) – brief description of work placement procedures and expectations

[The NMIT – Industry Focused IT Student Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JICsHf8kkRXh4fAFaPI7MvCKorE0wetjXzyoQVyGYik/edit?usp=sharing) is a form that specifies the work placement project. The workplace contact/employer is filling it in.

The [Workplace Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vgzhd4G7COfXxTR9axB9eC9zQRsy6oc27GhJoz8oIro/edit?usp=sharing) is the assessment of the student performance at the workplace by the contact person/employer. The score from this assessment replaces the supervisor score in the project report (20%).

#### The PRJ70x Class Blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new RES701 Class Blog Space, built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
We are also in the process of building a new public site/platform to connect employers and students for work placements, job opportunities, etc. There will also be information for employers - and other interested parties - regarding placement procedures, previous projects...
During this transition there might still be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old PRJ70x blog](https://prj701.wordpress.com/)

#### Poster Creation - Non Compulsory Session Semester 2, 2020
<small>October 29 2020</small>

The session will be on Thursday the 5th of November, 1 pm — 3 pm in A215. You might be busy with the last details in your report – or you are ready to celebrate a job well done? In any scenario, the session is there.

We will just have a look at previous students’ posters, discuss design ideas and look at different tools to create your poster. If you are unable to come – look in this blog under 'Your Poster' and you can get inspiration from previous posters.

While the poster does not contribute as much as the report to your final grade, it is still a very important part of the project’s assessment, as your poster is your way of showing the world what you have done in your project.  You want people to read it, be engaged by it and use it as the basis for asking you interesting questions. Therefore you should spend a realistic amount of time designing, preparing your poster and demonstration. Also, ensure that your name, your supervisor’s name and the NMIT Logo (zip file with several variations) is linked on NMIT Moodle just above the poster Dropbox, above in this blog and [here](https://ecampus.nmit.ac.nz/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=625225).

Once complete, please put a copy of your poster file into the dropbox on Moodle.

**Instructions for preparation of posters for best print quality**

Design your poster at the A1 size which is 594 * 841mm. Designing at A4 size and blowing it up is not a good option.
If you wish the posters cut to bleed (print right to the edge after cutting), they should be 596 *843mm so that they can trim 1mm off all sides and still accommodate the A1 size.
Supply as a high resolution (minimum 300dpi) pdf or jpg file.  If supplied as a pdf, convert all text to paths or outlines, to ensure that fonts do not change.

**Poster Creation Techniques & Tools**

As first general rule would be to always create a ‘paper size’ of A1 (or the measurements of A1) to work on – no matter which tool or software you are using. This way you achieve both to have an overview of what you are putting on your poster, and you are getting a good resolution when you are printing out.

Discussions with previous about tools/software to create posters, we came to the conclusion, that the following tools could be recommended – with increased difficulty and complexity from top to bottom of the list:

* Word
* Publisher
* PowerPoint
* Visio
* Photoshop

The printing shops will be able to print out Word files and graphics files from Photoshop and Publisher. If you are working with other file formats – just choose ‘Save As’ and select PDF in those applications. And the A1 sized PDF can be printed out at the printing shop.

You are free to have your poster printed wherever you like, but in the past we have suggested either Speedy Print Nelson Ltd., 75 Buxton Square, Nelson or The Warehouse Stationery in Bridge Street. I haven’t checked for a while, but you can probably get your poster printed and laminated for around $30.

**Poster Design**

According to me posters should be;

_Big – Bold – Simple – Explanatory_

I think that designs based mainly on diagrams and models, without much text, achieve that.

The following tutorials have been selected by my friend Klaas Breukel. He is teaching design and CGI here at NMIT.

_Be creative!_

We have the second compulsory seminar, Thursday the 15th of October at 1 pm – 3 pm in A215. Please be ready to make a micro presentation about your project and how it has developed and progressed. No slides, no formal stuff – just a couple of minutes of you talking and answering questions.

#### Report Writing - Compulsory Session Semester 2 2020, Thursday, September 24, 1-3 pm, Room A215
<small>September 24 2020</small>

Next compulsory seminar session is happening - Thursday, September 24, 1-3 pm, Room A215.

#### First Compulsory Session Semester 2, 2020 
<small>August 20 2020</small>

**NB Compulsory Attendance**

Finally the first seminar session is happening - Thursday, August 20, 1-3 pm, Room A215.
After a brief introduction from me, you will individuallybe presenting your project and your progress. Please remember that no no more than 5 min is allocated to each student. Less is perfectly OK. Also, it is an informal presentation, so no slides are needed - you can if you like, though. Main thing is that we get a clear picture of what you are doing in your project and how it is going.
See you on Thursday :)

**NB Compulsory Attendance**

#### More about project approval
<small>August 10 2020</small>

Last Friday all students were notified of supervisor allocation. The way we are running the process this year, is that we allocate a
supervisor first, and then you work with him/her to fine-tune the
project. Therefore the supervisor will be the one who is communicating the approval with you.

#### Project approval update
<small>August 6 2020</small>

Most of the proposals were uploaded from approval, Monday. The ones with extension were uploaded  Wednesday morning. You proposals were discussed in our Wednesday staff meeting. On Friday some students will be notified of approval status. The rest will follow on Monday.

Please be aware that out of your officially timetabled PRJ70x classes, only 3 of them are compulsory. Others will be optional. You can see the list of planned sessions in Moodle. I will also always advertise an upcoming session in advance - here and in MS Teams.

#### Welcome to Semester 2, 2020 
<small>July 20 2020</small>

Welcome to semester 2, 2020. I am Lars, and I will be the coordinator for the Project Paper.

We are having our first session for student new to the paper on Thursday, 30th of July, 1 pm - 3 pm in A215. Everyone who currently enrolled in PRJ701/702 and/or already working on a project should attend, so we are sure that all project students meet and share information, questions and experiences.

The way the information for this course is organised, is that corse descriptions, assessment schedules, assessment guidelines, drop boxes, etc. – in short all static official information – is sitting on the Moodle Site. This Jekyll blog is our dynamic communication interface – including tips, links, guides and information about previous projects.

Please take time to have a good read through the course documents.  The course can appear complicated at first sight – so it is important that you get an overview of the structure before we meet.

Warm regards, Lars
