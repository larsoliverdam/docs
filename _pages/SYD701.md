#### The birth of one of the most common metaphores in our sector
<small>12 March 2020</small>

Spam (stylized as SPAM) is a brand of canned cooked pork made by Hormel Foods Corporation, based in Minnesota. (Wikipedia)

#### Metaphors
<small>12 March 2020</small>

Metaphor:  
/ˈmɛtəfə,ˈmɛtəfɔː/  
noun  

> A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable
>
> The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another

From the Google Dictionary

Today topic it metaphors – during the session you will hopefully experience why 🙂

Here are some initial questions:

1. What are some common examples?
2. Why do we use them?
3. Do we always know when we are using them?
4. What is useful about using metaphors?
5. What are the issues in using metaphors?

#### Computer Metaphors
<small>12 March 2020</small>

Please answer the questions in groups and write them down in the Google Doc. We’ll talk about them after you have finished.

#### Metaphores in the World of IT
<small>12 March 2020</small>

> To a large extent, computer operating systems, computer applications,
> and entire computer concepts use metaphor as a means of providing a
> way for people to comprehend and use these abstractions. Commands
> such as save, copy, move, cut, paste, launch, and open, to name just a few,
> are all metaphoric. Items in the graphical user interface such as the
> desktop, the recycle bin or the trashcan, the control panel, the folder,
> the scroll bar, and the window itself are metaphoric as well. And so are the
> notions of cyberspace, navigation, going to a site, and many other
> Internet-based concepts. The vast majority of computer users, in fact,
> experience the technology primarily through metaphor, to the degree
> that the technology itself is almost entirely obscured.

#### Homework for Thursday the 19th of March
<small>12 March 2020</small>

Try to capture the essence of the discussion we had about Metaphors. There are two links in this blog about our discussion. One about general metaphors and another one about computer related metaphors. Write – in a short way – what the answers were and what it means for our work as IT specialists (or students).

#### Autonomus Actors and Self Regulating Systems
<small>5 March 2020</small>

Just a little initial reflection on the subject of systems; we often think of systems as consciously initiated  and maintained. I our culture (especially the educational- and business culture) we also often see them as hierarchical. But systems can also be non hierarchical and self regulating.

What I like to to compare this with, is AI in CGI contexts. Below there are a couple of links as examples. We will discuss the concept is later in the class today.

Here is an example on a human level:

And on a more complicated level – what do we really need management systems for?

#### Problems, Puzzles & Messes

> Worst thing we can do is to take a mess, treat it as a problem and solve it as a puzzle  

<small>Pidd, M. (1997). Tools for thinking—Modelling in management science. Journal of the Operational Research Society, 48(11), 1150-1150</small>  

#### Homework for the next session
<small>5 March 2020</small>

Describe and analyse a problem, a puzzle and a mess. Of you own choice.
And write it up in you blog - as usual :)

#### Your first blog posting for SYD701
<small>27 February 2020</small>

For the first blog posting I would like you to reflect over the model I draw up on the board, about the Mehodlogy - Methods - Tools levels. Also, mention examples of IT-Systems and Non-IT Systems.

After that, please mention what you can do now in terms of Systems Development and what you would like to be able to do in the future.

Important for this posting – as with all other postings in my courses – is that you take time to think about what you are writing. You can’t rush that. But please don’t feel an obligation to write a lot that hasn’t got any meaning. And for goodness sake – do not copy stuff from somewhere else. Fell free to connect you ideas to ideas you find somewhere else, though. In that case – reference it.

#### Intro exercise to what Systems Development Methodologies is
<small>27 February 2020</small>

This is one of these typical intro exercises. You are working in groups to come up with good questions as to what we are dealing with here in SYD701. You are formulating the questions in the Google Doc’s with the links below.
Please take the the excise seriously in terms of formulating questions that actually make sense. But not seriously in terms of trying to meet my expectations.
We will go through all the questions after you have formulated them.

Have fun.

#### The old RES701 blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new SYD701 Class Blog Space. This blog is built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
During the transition, there might be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old SYD701 blog](https://nmitsyd701.wordpress.com/).
