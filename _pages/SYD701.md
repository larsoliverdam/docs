#### Autonomus Actors and Self Regulating Systems
<small>5 March 2020</small>

Just a little initial reflection on the subject of systems; we often think of systems as consciously initiated  and maintained. I our culture (especially the educational- and business culture) we also often see them as hierarchical. But systems can also be non hierarchical and self regulating.

What I like to to compare this with, is AI in CGI contexts. Below there are a couple of links as examples. We will discuss the concept is later in the class today.

Here is an example on a human level:

And on a more complicated level – what do we really need management systems for?

#### Homework for the next session
<small>5 March 2020</small>

Describe and analyse a problem, a puzzle and a mess. Of you own choice.
And write it up in you blog - as usual :)

#### Your first blog posting for SYD701
<small>27 February 2020</small>

For the first blog posting I would like you to reflect over the model I draw up on the board, about the Mehodlogy - Methods - Tools levels. Also, mention examples of IT-Systems and Non-IT Systems.

After that, please mention what you can do now in terms of Systems Development and what you would like to be able to do in the future.

Important for this posting – as with all other postings in my courses – is that you take time to think about what you are writing. You can’t rush that. But please don’t feel an obligation to write a lot that hasn’t got any meaning. And for goodness sake – do not copy stuff from somewhere else. Fell free to connect you ideas to ideas you find somewhere else, though. In that case – reference it.

#### Intro exercise to what Systems Development Methodologies is
<small>27 February 2020</small>

This is one of these typical intro exercises. You are working in groups to come up with good questions as to what we are dealing with here in SYD701. You are formulating the questions in the Google Doc’s with the links below.
Please take the the excise seriously in terms of formulating questions that actually make sense. But not seriously in terms of trying to meet my expectations.
We will go through all the questions after you have formulated them.

Have fun.

#### The old RES701 blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new SYD701 Class Blog Space. This blog is built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
During the transition, there might be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old SYD701 blog](https://nmitsyd701.wordpress.com/).
