#### The old RES701 blog

This is the new SYD701 Class Blog Space. This blog is built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
During the transition, there might be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old SYD701 blog](https://nmitsyd701.wordpress.com/).
