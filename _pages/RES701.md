#### Why do we look for ‘academic’ articles?
<small>May 8 2020</small>

It is important for :

Content

* find out what other, more knowledgeable people have said about the area
* find what is likely to be the most ‘credible’ information that you can find
* ground your work in work that others have done (no one expects you to come up with a completely original idea

Method

* look at the kind of research approach that others have taken 
* understand how others have applied the research approach to learn how to do it well  

It is useful to:

* see what questions others have left unanswered.  There may be room for you to pick up one of those questions yourself.
* find a useful starting point for your own work.

**What is an ‘academic’ article?**
When I refer to an academic article or paper, I am generally meaning a summary of research that has been published in a peer-reviewed journal or presented at a peer-reviewed conference.   Although, Masters and PhD theses are also ‘academic’ they are too long and too detailed to be ‘papers’.  Generally a paper will be around 4,000 – 8,000 words long  or somewhere around 5 – 10 printed pages.  They are usually written by academics but not always!

Of course, on the internet you will also find a large number of papers or articles that are not considered to be academic, these could be newspaper articles, articles from practitioner journals, blog postings, vanity publishing, white papers from companies such as Microsoft or IBM among others.  These can often have useful information but as we have discussed, they are not always 'valid' as research and are often biased.

There are also things which fall in between the two - papers such as university working papers, individually published work by academics (on a blog perhaps).  Again these can be useful but you will need to be clear about whether they are really useful as a basis for your research by looking at some of the criteria below.

**So how can you tell what is academic or not?** 
Before the internet, it was reasonably straightforward to identify such articles (or 'papers') as they would generally be published either in specialised research journals or books, or in the proceedings of academic conferences.  Of course, this still happens and often their abstracts are freely available online. However, a number of publishers charge a fee to read the complete paper.

Generally, if you have searched on NMIT’s online library databases or used an academic search engine like Google Scholar, the results you find will be academic.  This is because they have already screened out the non-academic work – they have done some of the hard work for you already!  However, if you are still not sure you can usually tell by looking at the criteria below.

Usually, an academic paper will be reporting on primary research of some kind and will have been peer-reviewed.   Most academic papers are also written to a very similar structure which not only makes it easier to read but also easier to work out what kind of article it is.
The main components of an academic paper are:

* the title
* the authors (usually with an email address and affiliation)
* the abstract
* the introduction
* a review of other papers relevant to the topic ( a literature review)
* a description of what the research was and what the researchers did
* the results of what they did
* a discussion about what the results mean
* a conclusion
* a list of references

**If the paper you find does not have an abstract and/or has no references, it is very unlikely to be an academic article.**


#### Blog posting for next week
<small>March 31 2020</small>

As you might have seen in the news section of the blog - I have to realise that there is no way that you will be ready to submit RES701 Assignment 2, only one week into the next term. I have postponed it to the 24th of May.

#### Blog posting for next week
<small>March 20 2020</small>

Find at least 3 different sources of evidence (e.g. a blog post, a journal article, youtube video etc.) for each of the two topics listed below (6 in total). You don’t need to read or watch them.

Try to find as many different kinds of sources of evidence as you can but try to find at least two sources which you think might be ‘academic papers/articles.

Topics:

* Computational Thinking
* Virtualisation Technology

Write a blog post and for each source you find:

1. post the URL, e.g. http://
2. the search terms you used,
3. how you found it (e.g. Google search or followed link from wikipedia)
4. who wrote/created it
5. when it was written/created/recorded/published  
6. what kind of ‘publication’ it is (e.g. news item, youtube video, white paper)
7. how  ‘credible (believable)’  you think it is  – include your reasons

#### Presentations next week
<small>March 20 2020</small>

Preparation Work for the week after the term break

We will be looking at different kinds of methods/methodologies that can be used in our research. In preparation for that I would like you to investigate the topic below that you have been allocated. You are working together to make a short presentation next week - no more than 10 min:

1. Secondary Research - _Jason & Callum_
2. Observational Research - _Lars_
3. Exploratory Research - _Jono, Asha George & Vishnupriya_
4. Case Study Research - _Aileen, Vishnu & Sujani_
5. Experimental Research - _Kashish & Mahir_
6. Discourse Analysis - _Mariya & Nikhil Reddy_
7. Action Research - _Asriel, Max, Aaron & Anushka_
8. Meta-Analysis - _Akhil & Chamara_
9. Randomised Controlled Trials - _Jayden & AJ_
10. Design-based research - _Vishvat, Suhaib & Sharad_

For your topic I want you to answer these questions as a presentation,
Also, you will create an individual blog post as homework for the week after the presentation (you can include links to other information or videos etc if you want):

1. What is it ? (Short description of how it works)
2. What kinds of questions/problems might it be useful for?
3. How could it be used in IT research  (try to think of an example)?
4. What are the strengths of the approach?
5. What are the weaknesses of the approach?

#### A little exercise about credibility/validity
<small>March 20 2020</small>

This is a little survey that hopefully will lead to a discussion about credibility.

You open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yxGGF7nfgU2zS2AO2D7VTb4xf9GGGgO4vxX3uhUAa94/edit?usp=sharing), find the column with the number ID you have been assigned, and carefully think about how credible you think the listed resources are (do not think very, very long, though). And then you enter a value between 1 and 10 (1 is not credible, 10 is totally credible).

We will discuss the results afterwards.

#### Credibility & Validity
<small>March 20 2020</small>

* _Credibility - how believable is the information you have found?_
* _Validity - how likely is it to be ‘true’ - i.e ‘valid’?_

**How do we know - or rather decide!?**
Mainly comes down to four questions;

* Does the epistemology match the ontology?  
i.e. was the means of discovering the information suitable for the question that was being asked or for the type of knowledge that was being searched for. In order to decide this you have to pay attention to the ‘question’ or ‘problem’ as well as what the researchers actually did.

* Was the method followed sufficiently rigorous?
i.e. is it repeatable or reproducible and can you follow the reasoning behind the conclusions that are being drawn? How well did they do the work?

* Who did the work/research? Do they seem credible?
i.e who do they work for, who paid for the research, where/what is the bias?

* Where and when was the work made public (or published)

#### Credibility & Validity

![Radioactivity](/docs/img/japan.jpg)

The massive (8.9) Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 resulted in a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns and releases of radioactive materials from the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear disaster since the catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine in April 1986.

In August 2013, news accounts quoted an official from Japan’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority as stating that highly radioactive water was seeping from the plant into the Pacific Ocean and creating an “emergency” situation that the plant’s operators were not adequately containing.

#### Blog posting for next week
<small>March 13 2020</small>

Thank you for today’s session – it was probably a challenge for all of us. But hopefully a rewarding one.

You blog posting for next week should be about research paradigms; please don’t try to recount everything that was said today, but try instead to give the posting your own personal touch and relate it to the work/courses you are currently doing – or have done. In other words make the posting relevant to yourself. Then there is a good chance that it might also be interesting for me and others to read.

Looking forward 🙂

#### Ontologies, Epistemologies into Paradigms; a small guide to my presentation today
<small>March 13 2020</small>

**Ontological continuum**

Ontologyrefers to our assumptions of what exists, or what is ‘real’.  It can range from **nominalism** (things are only what we as an individual think exists) to **realism** (believing that everything exists in an objective way and we can all experience it objectively).

Other positions include **‘constructivism’** – reality is socially constructed – some things only have an existence because we, as people, as a society or as a culture, agree that they do.

**Epistemological continuum**

**Epistemology**
refers to the type of valid knowledge that we can obtain about things.  This can be characterised in various ways for example from **positivism** (regularity, measurement, objective observation, causal effects) to **anti-positivism** (each person’s perception is valid).

One important view is that of those who believe in **interpretivism** – who believe that the researcher can never be objective and that human interpretation and understanding is also ‘valid’ knowledge.

**Research paradigms**
Where different ontologies overlap with different epistemological approaches,  we have ‘paradigms’ (or ways of undertaking the search for valid knowledge). For example, Western thought has for many centuries been characterized by the acceptance of the **‘classicscientific paradigm’** – a realist ontology with a positivist epistemology.

However, the **post-modernist movement** of the last half of the 20th century may be moving us towards a different paradigm as the epistemological position moves more towards an interpretivist or even anti-positivist (relativism) approach. Ontology **nominalism** (things are only what we as an individual think exists)

The **social science** paradigm falls somewhat in the middle and is often characterised by a ‘constructionist’ ontology and an interpretivist epistemology.  

Visual artists (i.e. painters) are much further toward the other ends of both continuums

#### Have I misunderstood what a scientific paradigm is?
<small>March 13 2020</small>

In the past concerned students have contacted me because they actually looked up what a Scientific Paradigm is – and the explanation is not at all like the one I gave.

Don’t worry – there are many ways of explaining what it is – my one might be a bit unusual. Try to choose one though, and see how much you can get out of it. The main ones I talked about were:

* Classic Scientific Paradigm
* Social Science Paradigm
* Post-Modernist Approach

And then I mentioned one single method that possibly could bypass a definite choice; Design Science. But there are many other paradigms and methods – and ways to escape a definite choice. Confused?

You should be 🙂

But from now on we are making things simpler – hopefully 🙂

#### Questions about truth and facts
<small>March 6 2020</small>

1. Is there adifference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?
2. What is ‘truth’?
3. What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?
4. Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?
5. What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?
6. What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change ?
7. How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?
8. “We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?
9. “Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” (Einstein) What does this mean?
10. Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!

#### Blog posting for next week
<small>March 6 2020</small>

1. What is ontology? How is it relevant to research? 
2. What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?
3. What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?

Next week we will discuss the Scientific Paradigms – and get started with thinking about the first assignment.

#### First blog posting
<small>February 28 2020</small>

Follow the instructions in for exmple WordPress.com to set up the blog. If you are using an existing blog, please create a RES701 category.

Email me the url; Lars.Dam@nmit.ac.nz

Write your first post:

* What do you think ‘research’ is?
* Do you think you will ever need research skills?
* What do you think a research journal is and who is it written for?
* What is plagiarism?
* Why is it important to avoid it?

#### Why blogging in RES701?
<small>February 28 2020</small>

As you might have sensed by now, it is very important for this course, that we create and maintain a ‘research community’. One of the most important and efficient ways of doing this, is to write up your reflections on the discussions and the presentations in the classroom and what you are learning, as we move along.

This means staying up to date with this blog and update you own blog weekly – at least. So bookmark this blog and follow it.

As soon as possible, we will have links up to all of your blogs here. You will then be able to follow the learning journey of your classmates – selectively if you like 🙂

Don’t take the competition with your classmates to seriously. Some are very good at writing and if they are very competitive, they would have something impressive up most of the time. What I am looking for from everyone, is active participation and deep thinking. Which does require some writing at the end of the day. So – do your best – consistently 🙂 – as in any other teamwork.

#### The old RES701 blog 
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the new RES701 Class Blog Space, built for ongoing communications during the course.
Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
There might also be some interesting and/or relevant information on the [Old RES701 blog](https://nmitresearchmethods.wordpress.com/).
