#### The NET603 Class Blog
<small>February 2021</small>

This is the NET603 Class Blog space. Learning resources will all be posted here instead of Moodle. MS Teams will be used for daily communication and quick sharing of ideas and instructions. Moodle will only act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.

#### Week 16, 
<small>2 July 2020</small>

Im sending out the last results from NET603 right now. Please be aware - and I do apologise already – that the marks are slightly off for assignment 3. I ended up taking quite a bit out of it that I found irrelevant, and ended up with the little IPv6 report only in assignment 3. And it really doesn’t deserve a weighting of 35%. Most of you did take advantage of that, however. You produced a nice assignment 3 and had your mark hiked up a bit. But a couple of students whom we all know as excellent in the practical field, but not the greatest report writers, have been punished a little bit. It is very minor – but still...

#### Week 15, 
<small>25 June 2020</small>

Thank you for demonstration day :)
I have added the numbers now, and you can ask if you are impatient. You would probably have an idea as to how it was going, looking at my notes.
I will have you reports marked as well within a couple of days, and then I will send you a notification with the total result for Assignment 2.

BTW - I will let our ITS department know tomorrow, that we have finished the course. Therefore, they can delete all our resources and use the capacity for the upcoming NET701. So have a look at you work of art before it is too late.

#### Week 12, 
<small>28 May 2020</small>

I have suggested the Demonstration Session to be moved from the Thursday the 18th of June to Thursday the 25th of June.
The reason is a mistake I made with the planning of the PRJ70x Poster Presentation Event.
And the fact that I have some other social commitments on that day :)
Please let me know if it is a problem for you....and we can possibly replan.
All other due dates stay as they are.

#### Week 7, 
<small>1 April 2020</small>

I have worked on the ISO storage on TALOS VTE today. I have tried to update and orgaise the ISO's in there. I am a bit unsure how your access rights are - but someone have recently uploaded in there. If it is one of you, please ensure that you follow naming conventions, so the storage space makes sense to all of us. There was some stuff I couldn't make sense of (deleted) and some I was unsure about (re-organised).

Some of the ISO's might be hard to install, as they require a trial license. Try to obtain these individually. Others should be more straight forward. I have for example added some Ubuntu images.

I will work on alering the course material today and tomorrow, and let you know when I have finished the next version of it.

#### Week 5, What you could do the next week and a half
<small>26 March 2020</small>

I am frantically working on an update/upgrade of the course, so it can be run online only.
As you can see the MS Teams hub is up running now. I just need to define your workspaces, upload revised course documents, -schedule and assignments, and allocate course functionality to Moodle, the Class Blog, your blogs and the notebooks and streams in MS Teams.  It is being done next week, the latest.

Until then, please play around as much as you can in the TALOS VTE. I have done some work in there, and found that some of the ISO’s are too old to have full functionality. You can either choose to upgrade them after installation or upload you own, more recent version. 

Also, I have found that the switches are not working exactly as I was expecting. I have used switch 2, until now and it gives me full Internet access. I am not exactly sure how the other two switches in you space are set up – but please keep me and the rest of the class in the loop as you progress.

Finally a few reminders to maintain good community culture in there; I have for example seen Linux machines spinning directly on the ISO. Debian/Ubuntu can do that – but please do the installation and eject the ISO afterwards. Also, be economical with the ISO’s you upload.

One last piece of advise – I have found that the web client works perfectly well. But some machines benefit a lot from having Vmware tools installed in the machine. You will be prompted from your VMware interface to do it and how to do it. It makes a big difference in the GUI, file sharing and other functionality.

#### Week 4, Homework for next week
<small>19 March  2020</small>

A company has a 190.240.0.0/16 block. They now want to re-organise it into large blocks. They wish to have subnets that can handle at least 1000 hosts each.

You can substitute into the formulae 2<sup>S</sup> >= subnets required and 2<sup>H</sup>-2 >= hosts required - to determine the number of bits required.

Please calculate:

* S = bits used for subnetting
* H= bits used for the number of hosts in each subnet

Also, please calculate the following for the second subnet:

* subnet mask
* subnet address
* first usable address in that subnet
* last usable address in that subnet
* broadcast address of that subnet

**Also happening on Tuesday: Group 2 is presenting**

#### Week 2, Session 4 Classroom Session
<small>4 March  2021</small>

Today we start up with the first small beginnings for a network design for assignment 2. As the first steps towards a Top Down Network Design process, please relate to the following questions:

1. Look at what they should be able to do in the travel agency? 
2. What do they need to do to provide the services?
3. Write additional initial design ideas up in a brief overview
4. How do you initially think that you would design and build this?
5. Please formulate any questions/uncertainties you have at this stage.

Please put this in your blog - you can copy/paste or refer to the other group members if you do it together

**Group 1 is presenting their initial thinking next time :)**

#### Internal IP allocation for your space in TALOS VTE
<small>2 March  2021</small>

Firstly, I would like to remind you that if you would like to log into your project space on TALOS VTE, you have to use the folloing format of the username I handed out to you on MS Teams a few minutes ago: **TALOS\your-username**

Secondly, the range of IP adresses that you can use in there are as shown below (unless you put something behind a firewall/NAT service). Please note that I have given your project groups numbers. These numbers correspond with the number in front of the IP ranges:

1. 10.10.3.1 - 10.10.3.254
2. 10.10.4.1 - 10.10.4.254
3. 10.10.5.1 - 10.10.5.254
4. 10.10.6.1 - 10.10.6.254

* Subnet mask is 255.255.0.0
* Gateway is 10.10.1.1
* DNS: Use 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

#### Week 2, Session 3
<small>2 March  2021</small>

Today, we moved on with sub-netting, so you have the foundation to work more independently with it.

As for homework, I would like you to do the following:

* Sign up with [GitHub](https://education.github.com/students)
* Make sure that you [Azure Education Account](https://ecampus.nmit.ac.nz/moodle/course/view.php?id=4458) works, so we can access their free resources.
* Write up the subnetting exercise we did in the classroom (or a similar sub-netting example)

Next time we will start up with a short session about IPv4 vs. IPv6, do a little bit of subnetting and move on to network design discussions based on mainly Top-Down Network Design Strategy.

#### Week 1, Session 1 and 2
<small>23 February  2021</small>

Thank you for the first session. Good to meet you – and it it good to be back in the classroom again after the long break.

As homework for the next session (Thursday), I would like you to do the following:

* Form work groups of 2-3 students– and send the names to me
* Each one of you create a blog (WordPress, etc.). Please make sure that commenting is enabled on the blog
* Send me the link so I can add it to this blog
* First blog posting - present yourself: Write what experience you previously have had with Infrastructure and networks. And what personal ambitions you have in the area.
* Get an Ethernet connector for your laptop
* Subscribe to [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJ4jKAvMMg56WGhqrZHFgw/featured) (if you feel like it)
* As the last thing – please bring pen and paper the next few weeks

The blog is there for you to document the progression of your project (Assignment 2) and the workshops for Assessment 3. This means write what you have done, what you are doing at the moment, and what you are planning to do in the near future. When we have started working on assignment 2, I expect a weekly posting on the blog.

See you on Thursday.
