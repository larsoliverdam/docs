#### First Classroom Session
<small>25 February  2020</small>

Thank you for the first session. Good to meet you – and it it good to be back in the classroom again after the long break.

As homework for the next session (Thursday), I would like you to do the following:

* Form work groups of 2-3 students
* Each group create a blog (WordPress, etc.) where all group members have editing access. Also, make sure that commenting  is enabled on the blog.
* Send me (Lars.Dam@nmit.ac.nz) the link with your names, so I can add it to this blog
* As the last thing – please bring pen and paper the next few weeks

The blog is there for you to document the progression of your project (assignment2). That means write what you have done, what you are doing at the moment, and what you are planning to do in the near future. When we have started working on assignment 2, I expect a weekly posting on the blog with at least one contribution from each group member. You could start up with a first posting in there about yourself - what kind of network/infrastructure work you have done in the past, what you expect to learn/do in this course and what infrastructure work you would like to do in the future (after graduation)

See you on Thursday.

#### What is the NET603 blog?

<small>February 2020</small>

This is the NET603 Class Blog Space. News, instructions, ideas....they will all be posted here instead of Moodle. Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
