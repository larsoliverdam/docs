#### First Classroom Session
<small>25 February  2020</small>

Thank you for the first session. Good to meet you – and it it good to be back in the classroom again after the long break.

As homework for the next session (Thursday), I would like you to do the following:

* Form work groups of 2-3 students
* Each group create a blog (WordPress, etc.) where all group members have editing access. Also, make sure that commenting  is enabled on the blog
* Send me the link with your names, so I can add it to this blog
* As the last thing – please bring pen and paper the next few weeks

See you on Thursday.

#### What is the NET603 blog?
<small>February 2020</small>

This is the NET603 Class Blog Space. News, instructions, ideas....they will all be posted here instead of Moodle. Moodle will act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.
