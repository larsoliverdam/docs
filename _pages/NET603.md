#### The NET603 Class Blog
<small>February 2021</small>

This is the NET603 Class Blog space. Learning resources will all be posted here instead of Moodle. MS Teams will be used for daily communication and quick sharing of ideas and instructions. Moodle will only act as the static course place holder for assignments, drop-boxes, etc.

#### Week 16, 
<small>2 July 2020</small>

Im sending out the last results from NET603 right now. Please be aware - and I do apologise already – that the marks are slightly off for assignment 3. I ended up taking quite a bit out of it that I found irrelevant, and ended up with the little IPv6 report only in assignment 3. And it really doesn’t deserve a weighting of 35%. Most of you did take advantage of that, however. You produced a nice assignment 3 and had your mark hiked up a bit. But a couple of students whom we all know as excellent in the practical field, but not the greatest report writers, have been punished a little bit. It is very minor – but still...

#### Week 15, 
<small>25 June 2020</small>

Thank you for demonstration day :)
I have added the numbers now, and you can ask if you are impatient. You would probably have an idea as to how it was going, looking at my notes.
I will have you reports marked as well within a couple of days, and then I will send you a notification with the total result for Assignment 2.

BTW - I will let our ITS department know tomorrow, that we have finished the course. Therefore, they can delete all our resources and use the capacity for the upcoming NET701. So have a look at you work of art before it is too late.

#### Week 12, 
<small>28 May 2020</small>

I have suggested the Demonstration Session to be moved from the Thursday the 18th of June to Thursday the 25th of June.
The reason is a mistake I made with the planning of the PRJ70x Poster Presentation Event.
And the fact that I have some other social commitments on that day :)
Please let me know if it is a problem for you....and we can possibly replan.
All other due dates stay as they are.

#### Week 6, Session 11
<small>30 March 2021</small>

**Links to Disaster recovery & Back-Up Strategies**

*[3-2-1 Backup: What It Means and How to Achieve It](https://www.msp360.com/resources/blog/following-3-2-1-backup-strategy/)

*[Disaster recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective)

#### Week 4, Session 8
<small>18 March 2021</small>

**What we discussed today:**

__Sub-netting example – TALOS:__
NMIT has an Internet address of 202.49.18.0 /24. TALOS has been given a 202.49.18.0/26 subnet. 

Question 1:
What are the subnet addresses of each of the /26 subnets that NMIT can give out? Please show your calculations including binary workings and dotted decimal conversions. 

Question 2:
How many external IP addresses (the maximum in its subnet) could TALOS use on its firewall? Please show your calculations including binary workings and dotted decimal conversions. 

[__Also the link to Top-Down-Netdesign__](https://www.test-king.com/guide-640-864-describe-top-down-approach-to-network-design.htm)

#### Week 3, Session 5
<small>9 March 2021</small>

Please play around as much as you can in the TALOS VTE. I have done some work in there, and found that some of the ISO’s are too old to have full functionality. You can either choose to upgrade them after installation or upload you own, more recent version. But be a bit economical with the ISO’s you upload :)

Also a little reminders to maintain good community culture in there; Linux and BSD machines can spinn directly on the ISO. So Debian/Ubuntu and pfSense can do that – so please do the installation and eject the ISO afterwards.

One last piece of advise –  all  machines benefit a lot from having Vmware tools installed in the machine. You will be prompted from your VMware interface to do it and how to do it. It makes a big difference in the GUI, file sharing and other functionality. PfSense has a special package in the package manager that does it.

#### Week 3, Homework
<small>9 March  2021</small>

A company has a 190.240.0.0/16 block. They now want to re-organise it into large blocks. They wish to have subnets that can handle at least 1000 hosts each.

You can substitute into the formulae 2<sup>S</sup> >= subnets required and 2<sup>H</sup>-2 >= hosts required - to determine the number of bits required.

Please calculate:

* S = bits used for subnetting
* H= bits used for the number of hosts in each subnet

Also, please calculate the following for the second subnet:

* subnet mask
* subnet address
* first usable address in that subnet
* last usable address in that subnet
* broadcast address of that subnet

**Also happening on Tuesday: Group 1 is presenting**
#### Week 2, Session 4
<small>4 March  2021</small>

Today we start up with the first small beginnings for a network design for assignment 2. As the first steps towards a Top Down Network Design process, please relate to the following questions:

1. Look at what they should be able to do in the travel agency? 
2. What do they need to do to provide the services?
3. Write additional initial design ideas up in a brief overview
4. How do you initially think that you would design and build this?
5. Please formulate any questions/uncertainties you have at this stage.

Please put this in your blog - you can copy/paste or refer to the other group members if you do it together

**Group 1 is presenting their initial thinking next time :)**

#### Internal IP allocation for your space in TALOS VTE
<small>2 March  2021</small>

Firstly, I would like to remind you that if you would like to log into your project space on TALOS VTE, you have to use the folloing format of the username I handed out to you on MS Teams a few minutes ago: **TALOS\your-username**

Secondly, the range of IP adresses that you can use in there are as shown below (unless you put something behind a firewall/NAT service). Please note that I have given your project groups numbers. These numbers correspond with the number in front of the IP ranges:

1. 10.10.3.1 - 10.10.3.254
2. 10.10.4.1 - 10.10.4.254
3. 10.10.5.1 - 10.10.5.254
4. 10.10.6.1 - 10.10.6.254

* Subnet mask is 255.255.0.0
* Gateway is 10.10.1.1
* DNS: Use 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

#### Week 2, Session 3
<small>2 March  2021</small>

Today, we moved on with sub-netting, so you have the foundation to work more independently with it.

As for homework, I would like you to do the following:

* Sign up with [GitHub](https://education.github.com/students)
* Make sure that you [Azure Education Account](https://ecampus.nmit.ac.nz/moodle/course/view.php?id=4458) works, so we can access their free resources.
* Write up the subnetting exercise we did in the classroom (or a similar sub-netting example)

Next time we will start up with a short session about IPv4 vs. IPv6, do a little bit of subnetting and move on to network design discussions based on mainly Top-Down Network Design Strategy.

#### Week 1, Session 1 and 2
<small>23 February  2021</small>

Thank you for the first session. Good to meet you – and it it good to be back in the classroom again after the long break.

As homework for the next session (Thursday), I would like you to do the following:

* Form work groups of 2-3 students– and send the names to me
* Each one of you create a blog (WordPress, etc.). Please make sure that commenting is enabled on the blog
* Send me the link so I can add it to this blog
* First blog posting - present yourself: Write what experience you previously have had with Infrastructure and networks. And what personal ambitions you have in the area.
* Get an Ethernet connector for your laptop
* Subscribe to [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJ4jKAvMMg56WGhqrZHFgw/featured) (if you feel like it)
* As the last thing – please bring pen and paper the next few weeks

The blog is there for you to document the progression of your project (Assignment 2) and the workshops for Assessment 3. This means write what you have done, what you are doing at the moment, and what you are planning to do in the near future. When we have started working on assignment 2, I expect a weekly posting on the blog.

See you on Thursday.
