**Job/Work Placement Opportunity**

We are looking for someone with experience or understanding of the platforms WordPress and Shopify. Most of the sites we currently manage are based of existing templates. Must be good with UI and an understanding in front and backend development.

A lot of the work will be remote, as our clients are international at this point in time. We will be initially be looking for someone part time... with the view to move quickly into fulltime.

We also work in film and photography, so there could be additional work/work experiences there too.
