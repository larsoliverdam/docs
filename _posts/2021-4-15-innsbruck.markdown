I have resigned from NMIT to take up a position at the University of Innsbruck in Austria as a Learning Management System Developer. My last classroom sessions will be just before the mid-semester break.

I am working closely with my team and our managers to avoid any disruptions in the course delivery. Also, I will do my very best to ensure that students are well prepared for the transition.
