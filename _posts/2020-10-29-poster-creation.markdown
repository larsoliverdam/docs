The session will be on Friday the 5th of November, 1 pm — 3 pm in A215. You might be busy with the last details in your report – or you are ready to celebrate a job well done? In any scenario, the session is there.
My designer friend Klaas Breukel has promised to come in briefly in the beginning of the session to tell us what real design is.

Otherwise, we will just have a look at previous students’ posters, discuss design ideas and look at different tools to create your poster.

Especially if you are unable to attend – look in this blog under PRJ70x and read the most recent entry about the poster creation session.
