You project supervisors were allocated yesterday. Some supervisors might contact you - but I will send out emails to each project student later today, to avoid any confusion.

Most proposals have been approved, but some need a bit more work. Your allocated supervisor will assist you with that.
Don't hesitate sending me questions - but please wait until you have recieved an email today.

If your question(s) are relevant to all of us - please post it in the MS Teams forum.

Hope you are all well :)

PS: Please also send me your Project Journal/Blog URL - if you haven't done it yet.
