Nominations are now open for this year’s Student Representatives (rep), for all our courses.  The student rep will speak on behalf of other students raising both positive and negative issues.  SANITI  hold student rep meetings that the class rep can attend. Meetings also take place once a term with me and I pass on your feedback to the relevant people.

This is a great opportunity for students to gain experience and skills in communication and leadership that are transferable into the work environment. There is a booklet available on SANITI’s website if you would like any further information or feel free to pop into the SANITI office and have a chat.

We usually have one or two students reps for each level of a programme. This covers  the Level 5 Certificate, Level 5 Diplomas, the Bachelor of Information Technology, the Graduate Diploma in IT and the Post Graduate Diploma in IT Security management.

Please nominate one student rep for your level.

If you attend a Level 5 course, then send one email to me to nominate a student rep for Level 5.
If you attend a Level 6 courses, then send one email to me to nominate a student rep for Level 6.
If you attend a Level 7 courses, then send one email to me to nominate a student rep for Level 7.
If you attend for Level 8  courses, then send one email to me to nominate a student rep for Level 8.
You can nominate someone in your class or you can self nominate.  I would be happy to see last years student reps puts their hands up again as well

Please email me (trisha.krishnasamy@nmit.ac.nz) with your nominations before Friday 13th March 2020.

Kind regards

Trisha
