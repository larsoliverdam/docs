I made a mistake in my planning again. I had initially scheduled the Poster Presentation Evening on the 25th of June.
Somehow that changed, but I did not change the date in your material.
I am awfully sorry!

**Poster Presentation Evening is the 18th of June, 4 pm - 6 pm. Your poster has to be up before 4.30pm. The format of the presentation is still to be confirmed (Covid-19 precausions)**
