We are all back on campus next week. In the courses where you are working independently towards the last assessment, and I have advertised that there is no compulsory attendance, it is still the case. But it will be limited how much online assistance I can provide, so I will encourage you to turn up in the class session time. If you do not turn up, I will need to contact you to track your progress.

For the classes with normal attendance, you will need to follow the usual procedure (sick certificate, etc.), if you are unable to attend.
