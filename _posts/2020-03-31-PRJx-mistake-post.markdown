I postponed the seminar that was supposed to happen Friday the 3rd of April to the following week, Friday the 10th of April.
BUT - I forgot to check my holiday calendar - it is Good Friday. I can't possibly ask you to be in a meeting on Good Friday.
The seminar will happen online, using Zoom **Friday the frist of May**.

So sorry for the mistake and the confusion that I have created.
