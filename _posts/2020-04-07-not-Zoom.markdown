I have done the first online classroom session now. And I have to realise that I have to reorganise my setup slightly:
The following new layout applies to all of my classes:

* MS Teams will be the classroom hub. I have organised one team/course. Please ensure that you have the application installed
* Within the individual teams there will channels for permanent groups and notebooks for each student. We will utilise those to the extend we feel like
* You will remain using your individual blog/journal as before
* Moodle will have the same role as before
* We will __NOT__ be using Zoom for the classroom sessions.
* Upcoming classroom sessions will be announced with an invitation in teams
* The call function within MS Teams will be used for classroom session, presentations, individual discussion (tutor – student, student – student, etc.). group meetings - basically everything
* Please ensure that you are avalible in your allocated groups (channels) during group session time
