I am back again at work after the Easter Break, so I will be available online for questions, help and clarifications during working hours.

During the past few weeks I have experienced a steep learning curve as how to organise learning and teaching. 

One of the main issues I have had to face, is that it is extremely important to avoid confusion about what we are doing, how we are doing it and when it is being done. Plain organisation.

Another, learning for me has been that it is very difficult to explain concepts online. It is easier to assign small working tasks and discuss the issues connected to them in smaller groups of students, as the tasks are solved. Which again leads to discussions about the concepts that you need to learn.

I will try to to take this into account in my future planning.

Looking forward to be seeing you again. And even more to be seeing you in the the classroom, some time in the future.
