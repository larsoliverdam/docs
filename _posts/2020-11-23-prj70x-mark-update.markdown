**Project marks are almost in – soon to be published**

The last external marking arrived this morning. This means that your results in principle are there – but you will have to wait for the moderation, which is happening the next couple of days, and the final approval of the results on Thursday morning. So you can probably expect your result to arrive in your NMIT mailbox Thursday/Friday.

The result will be one grade, but I will try to fit in as many comments from the markers as I can. And that often ends up a bit messy. Please bear over with me.
