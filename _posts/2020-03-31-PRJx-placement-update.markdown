I have just sent and email out our workplacement employers to assure them that regardless of the current situation,
we will support our students to pass their work placements project
exams. So if you are currently unable to be provided with work that you can do from home and therefore are unable to reach the number of
hours needed for a work placement project, we will guide you to create
a project report that meets the requirements. We have done that before
and enabled students to successfully pass with good results.

But please contact your allocated NMIT supervisor as soon as possible, if you have questions or if you are uncertain of the procedures.
