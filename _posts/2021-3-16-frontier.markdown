Frontier Media is currently looking for another frontend developer (part-time). They have asked if we would have any 3/4 year students or graduates who would be interested.

Itâ€™s not a software development role, but for Web Design - someone who can competently write HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery to work with our team making template based custom websites, based in our Nelson office.
