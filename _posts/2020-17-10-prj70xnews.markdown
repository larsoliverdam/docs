**First Compulsory Session Semester 2 2020, Thursday, August 20, 1-3 pm, Room A215**

**NB Compulsory Attendance**

Finally the first seminar session is happening - Thursday, August 20, 1-3 pm, Room A215.
After a brief introduction from me, you will individuallybe presenting your project and your progress. Please remember that no no more than 5 min is allocated to each student. Less is perfectly OK. Also, it is an informal presentation, so no slides are needed - you can if you like, though. Main thing is that we get a clear picture of what you are doing in your project and how it is going.
See you on Thursday :)
