This is the capstone project presentation event for BIT and GradDipIT students. Friends, family, work placement contacts and everyone else who is interested in what IT students can accomplish, are very welcome.

The event is organised as individual poster displays and demonstrations by the students, so you can both experience the diversity of IT studies at NMIT and discuss the challenges and achievements with the individual students.
