Bank of New Zealand is organising a local Nelson Speed Networking event Thursday March 19th, with the theme of Digital Technologies. The idea is to invite a number of local businesses and motivate them to embrace change through Digital Technologies. They would very much like 5-7 of our level 7 students to participate with their input.

If you contact me, Lars.Dam@nmit.ac.nz, I will forward the names and contact details of the people who are keen to attend and you will be sent an individual invitation to attend from the organisers.
 
* As for now the key questions to the businesses are:
* If you could only work on one project for your business for a year what would it be and why?
* What parts of your role/operation would you like to eliminate?
* If you could hire x5 more people, what unconventional skills would they have and why?
* Scenarios if X happened to your business how would you solve it?
